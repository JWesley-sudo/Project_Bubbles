### **CSS Instructions for Students**

1. **Create a CSS File**  
   - Create a file named `style.css` in the same directory as your HTML file. This is where you will write your custom CSS.

2. **Link the CSS File**  
   - Ensure your HTML file is linked to the `style.css` file using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section. This is already done in the provided HTML.

3. **Style the Navigation Bar (`#nav`)**  
   - Add styles to the navigation bar (`#nav`):
     - Set a background color.
     - Add padding and margin to position it properly.
     - Style the `#logo` image (e.g., set its width and height).
     - Style the `label` and `button` inside the navigation bar (e.g., font size, color, and hover effects).

4. **Style the Header (`#Header`)**  
   - Add styles to the header section:
     - Center-align the text.
     - Add a background color or image.
     - Style the `h1` and `h4` tags (e.g., font size, color, and spacing).
     - Style the `button` with the class `btn-puls` (e.g., add a pulsating animation).

5. **Style the Social Media Section (`#Social`)**  
   - Add styles to the social media icons:
     - Center-align the icons.
     - Add spacing between the icons.

   - Add styles to the contact icons:
     - Center-align the icons.
     - Add spacing between the icons.
     - Add hover effects to the icons (e.g., change color or scale on hover).

     - Position the images randomly on the page.
     - Add animations to make the bubbles float or move.
     - Adjust the size of the images.

9. **Add Global Styles**  
   - Set a global font family (e.g., `'Arial', sans-serif`).

   - Set a background color or image for the entire page.

10. **Add Hover Effects**  
    - Add hover effects to elements with the `hover` class (e.g., change color, scale, or add transitions).

    - Use CSS animations to make elements like the `btn-puls` button pulsate or the bubbles float.
